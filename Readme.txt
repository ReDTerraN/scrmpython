this is a statstracker for Starcraft Remastered. Its a work in progress and currently in its alpha.

The plan is to make graph's that can vizualize how it has been going in the ladder and what you as a player need to improve on.

Features to implement:

-winrate of different matchups.
-strategy tracker


you can use this code exactly how you want. If it helps you I feel both proud and at the same time sorry for you.
